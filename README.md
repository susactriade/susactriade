# susactriade
Susac syndrome software which target litterature based on clinical symptom triad

## Synopsis
Susac syndrome is a rare microangiopathy causing small infarcts in the brain, cochlea, and retina. It is characterized by the clinical triad of acute or subacute encephalopathy, sensorineural hearing loss, and branch retinal artery occlusions, mostly in young women.  Current knowledge on Susac syndrome is largely based on reports of single patients and small case series. Although Susac syndrome is presumed to be mediated by an inflammatory process, the pathogenesis of such vasculopathy remains unknown.

## Method
"susactriade" is a R-package software which allow to perform intersection with an input gene list and the Susac syndrome litterature by taking in account the symptomatic triad of the disease. With different MESH term queries around these sumptomatic triad, susactrade software target 3.341.156 articles in NCBI database when he was created on May 10th, 2018.
