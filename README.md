Susac syndrome software which target litterature based on clinical symptom triad

## Synopsis
Susac syndrome is a rare microangiopathy causing small infarcts in the brain, cochlea, and retina. It is characterized by the clinical triad of acute or subacute encephalopathy, sensorineural hearing loss, and branch retinal artery occlusions, mostly in young women.  Current knowledge on Susac syndrome is largely based on reports of single patients and small case series. Although Susac syndrome is presumed to be mediated by an inflammatory process, the pathogenesis of such vasculopathy remains unknown.
